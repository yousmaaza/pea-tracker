| **MACD** | 0.1680 | Positive |
| **MACD Signal** | 0.1429 | Bullish crossover |

#### Price Position Analysis

- **vs MA20:** +1.66% (bullish short-term trend)
- **vs MA50:** +2.46% (bullish medium-term trend)
- **vs MA200:** +2.46% (bullish long-term trend)

#### Key Technical Points

1. **Bullish MACD Crossover:** The MACD line (0.1680) has crossed above the signal line (0.1429), generating a bullish signal with positive histogram (0.0251)

2. **Strong Positioning Above Moving Averages:** Price is trading above all major moving averages (MA20, MA50, MA200), confirming a multi-timeframe uptrend

3. **RSI Warning:** RSI at 69.70 is approaching the overbought threshold of 70, suggesting limited short-term upside and potential for consolidation or pullback

#### Risk Factors

- RSI proximity to overbought levels increases probability of near-term profit-taking
- Limited margin of safety for new entries at current levels
- S&P 500 correlation means exposure to US market volatility

#### Recommendation

**Action:** WATCH - Do not initiate position at current levels

**Rationale:** While technical indicators show bullish momentum, the confidence score of 45/100 is below the 60-point threshold for actionable signals. The RSI approaching overbought territory suggests waiting for a healthier entry point.

**Preferred Entry Strategy:**
- Wait for RSI pullback to 50-60 range
- Monitor for price consolidation near MA20 (29.51 EUR)
- Look for volume confirmation on any breakout above 30.10 EUR
